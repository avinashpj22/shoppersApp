# Watch for:
⠙ Generating browser application bundles...
✔ Compiled successfully
```

## 🎯 Next Steps After App Loads

1. **Explore the UI** - Click through all pages
2. **Check Features** - Try cart, checkout, orders
3. **Open DevTools** - F12 to see network calls
4. **Read Code** - Check src/ folder structure
5. **Review Docs** - Understand architecture

---

## ⚠️ If Something Goes Wrong

**See a compilation error?**
- This is normal during startup
- Wait for auto-rebuild
- Check browser console (F12)

**Page won't load?**
- Check terminal for "Compiled successfully"
- Wait 30-60 seconds first time
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
- Check http://localhost:4200

**No products showing?**
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
- This uses mock data (no API needed)

---

## 🚀 Advanced: Start Backend Too

When frontend is working, start backend:

**Terminal 2:**
```powershell
cd backend/Gateway/ApiGateway
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

Wait for: `Now listening on: http://localhost:8000`

Now the frontend will connect to real backend API!
